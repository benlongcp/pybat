# This file has been modularized. Use main_async.py as the new entry point for the client application.
# All main classes and logic have been moved to:
#   - splitters.py
#   - dialogs.py
#   - lobby.py
#   - game_window.py
#   - handlers.py
#   - main_async.py

# To launch the client, run main_async.py

# (This file is now intentionally left blank.)
